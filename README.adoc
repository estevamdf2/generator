> _Java application that realize read using modBus of boards MCM and generators bound at this board.
After its using Zabbix Sender library for sent data of Zabbix Server.
Board model MCM3200 and Generator model C500D6_

== Tecnologies

* Java: JDK 8
* Modbus4J
* Zabbix Sender
* Apache Maven
* Zabbix Server - vers√£o 5.0.4
* Client modbus driver link:https://www.modbusdriver.com/modpoll.html[modpool]

== Zabbix Templates

Were created Zabbix Templates for realize the collect of data.
All registered itens were in templates they were obtain in manual of board.
link:docs/modbus2300.pdf[MCM 3320]

Manual of generator link:docs/C500D6_PT_REV01.pdf[Generator C500D6]

=== Template MCM Generators

Itens that realize read obtain of board model **MCM 3320** bound at generators.

link:docs/zabbix/zbx_export_templates_mcm.xml[Template MCM Generators]

=== Template Geradores

Itens that realize read obtain of generators bound at board model **MCM 3320**.

link:docs/zabbix/zbx_export_templates_generators.xml[Template Generators]

== Setup

This project needs information of configuration for be run. In this file be information as:

* Zabbix Server address
* Port of Zabbix
* Itens of generator
* Itens of board MCM
* etc

=== Configuration file

Sample of configuration file as be used.

[source,json]
include::setup/config-dist.json[]


**Important !!!**

The itens of generators and boards must be updated follow changes realized in Zabbix templates created for Zabbix.

- link:docs/zabbix/zbx_export_templates_generators.xml[Template - MCM Generators]
- link:docs/zabbix/zbx_export_templates_mcm.xml[Template - Generators]

=== Environment variable

You need create this environment variable `GENERATOR_ENVIRONMENT`. If you not create the configuration file load will be **config-devel.json** 

Values for environment:

- `development`: Load configurations for development environment;
- `production`: Load configurations for production environment.

== Apache Maven

The application used `Apache Maven` for build the executable of project `.jar`

=== Packaging of application

To build the executable of application run the command

```shell
mvn package
```

At the final of execution. You will be output similar that below:

```sh
[INFO] Scanning for projects...
[WARNING]
[WARNING] Some problems were encountered while building the effective model for br.com.myCompany:generator:jar:${PROJECT_VERSION-SNAPSHOT}
[WARNING] "version" contains an expression but should be a constant. @ line 5, column 11
[WARNING]
[WARNING] It is highly recommended to fix these problems because they threaten the stability of your build.
[WARNING]
[WARNING] For this reason, future Maven versions might no longer support building such malformed projects.

```

Will be create one directory called `target` and here will be available the executable of project. The file will be used is *generator-null-jar-with-dependencies.jar*

You maybe rename the file for exemple `generator.jar` for more easy to run application.

== Run application

After created the executable. Run this command

```shell
java -jar generator.jar
```

You will see the logs of application show in your terminal.
